          <p>So where do chanterelles grow?  They require established woodland to grow, which means they’re not likely to be cultivated anytime soon.  Chanterelles develop interdependent relationships with trees, called mycorrhizal relationships.  This relationship takes a while to establish, so they require a mature forest to grow.  A forest that’s been cut in the past few years won’t have chanterelles.  Look for older trees and a solid forest canopy.  They’re most commonly found around maple, beech, poplar, birch and oak trees.  In some areas, they’re associated with pine and fir trees, so it doesn’t have to be hardwood.</p>
          <p>Chanterelles require moist habitat, and they’re most abundant in wet summers with consistent rain. Chanterelles have forked ridges on their underside, and the forking is a characteristic of true chanterelle mushrooms.  They’re not exactly true gills, and they have blunt edges.  The ridges run down the stem of the mushroom, which is another identifier.</p>
