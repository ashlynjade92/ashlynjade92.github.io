          <p>In the odd world of fungi, the hedgehog mushroom still manages to stand out as eccentric. Its the joker in
          the pack, and for anyone who is struggling to get to grips with identifying edible wild mushrooms, its refusal
          to conform to even the loosest of mycological norms make it a godsend. Better still, it is fairly common,
          immune to insect attack and very tasty.</p>
          <p>Beneath the caps of most mushrooms you will usually find gills (ranging from the pink/brown slats of shop
          bought button mushrooms to the ‘combed plastercine’ effect of chanterelles) or pores (as in the spongy tube
          openings of boletes such as ceps). These fungal formats comprise over 90% of the good edible species, but also
          the vast majority of inedible, poisonous and downright lethal ones too. Many of the latter do frustratingly
          good impressions of the former. </p>
