          <p>In the crazy world of fungi, the hedgehog can be considered one of the more eccentric mushrooms. This is a great entry
            level mushroom for new foragers, as hedgehogs refuse to conform to the mycological norms. Aside from being easily identified, this mushroom is
          fairly common in the Northwest and is very delicious. They thrive along moist riverbeds and streams.</p>
          <p>The hedgehog mushroom looks very similar to the chanterelle from the top but has a very distinct underside.
          Unlike most mushrooms, hedgehogs do not have gills, but instead has a tooth-covered underside.
